/**
 * Resolves the variant's list price, creating it at most once across concurrent runs.
 *
 * THE RACE THIS CLOSES. `catalog_product_variant_prices` has NO unique
 * constraint on `(variant, currency, kind, min_quantity, channel_id)` — only
 * two plain lookup indexes (`catalog/data/entities.ts:778-828`). Products and
 * variants are protected by unique SKUs; prices are not. So the plain
 * find-then-create this replaced was a real time-of-check/time-of-use gap: two
 * seeds running at once both read "no price", both created one, and the variant
 * ended up with two active list prices.
 *
 * THE FIX WE ARE ALLOWED TO MAKE. Adding the missing unique index is the right
 * repair and is not ours to make — that is a core table and this app does not
 * migrate installed modules. Logged as an upstream observation instead. What we
 * can own is the critical section: a transaction-scoped Postgres advisory lock
 * keyed on the exact price identity, taken before the re-check, so a second run
 * waits outside until the first has committed and then finds the row instead of
 * adding one. Same mechanism core uses for the same shape of problem
 * (`notifications/lib/notificationService.ts:196-199`,
 * `attachments/lib/quota-service.ts:146`).
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, stated plainly. The `catalog.prices.create` command
 * resolves its own EntityManager fork, so its INSERT commits on a different
 * connection and is NOT inside this transaction — the lock gives mutual
 * exclusion between callers of this function, not atomicity of the write. A
 * writer that does not take this lock (the backend price editor, core's own
 * seeds, hand-written SQL) can still insert a duplicate, and only the missing
 * database constraint could stop that.
 *
 * A DUPLICATE, IF ONE EVER EXISTS, RESOLVES PREDICTABLY. `selectApplicablePrice`
 * in `catalogPricing.ts:132-158` sorts channel-specific before channel-less,
 * then the highest matching `minQuantity`, then the newest `createdAt`, then
 * the lowest id. That chain is total and its last key is unique, so the quote
 * picks the same row on every run rather than whichever one the database
 * happened to return first. Two identical seed rows differ only in id, so the
 * lower id wins, deterministically.
 *
 * Exported for the unit test only; the seed reaches it through
 * `seedFreightServices`.
