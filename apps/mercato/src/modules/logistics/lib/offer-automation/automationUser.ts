/**
 * The account every automatic quote is attributable to.
 *
 * WHY A USER AND NOT A SYSTEM ACTOR
 * ---------------------------------
 * The `inbox_ops` execution engine authorises every action against a real user
 * id (`executionEngine.ts` `ensureUserCanExecuteAction`), and the command bus
 * stamps that id onto the operation log of the quote it creates. A bot that
 * "ran as nobody" would either need the RBAC gate switched off or a zero-UUID
 * actor on a real sales document. So the automation gets an account, and
 * `sales_quotes` rows drafted by the machine carry an actor a human can tell
 * apart from a colleague at a glance.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS ALLOWED TO DO
 * ------------------------
 * Exactly one feature: `logistics.offers.draft`. The grant is a per-user
 * ACL, which `rbacService` uses EXCLUSIVELY when present (`rbacService.ts:227`),
 * so the account holds no role and inherits nothing — not `inbox_ops`
 * proposals, not `sales.quotes.view`, and never super-admin. That is also why
 * it never appears in the audience of the notifications this module sends: the
 * bot cannot see quotes, it can only draft them.

 * back to another user, because "the machine drafted this" must never quietly
