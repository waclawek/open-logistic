/**
 * UNSUPPORTED RUNTIME PATCH of an installed module's exported object.
 *
 * Why it exists
 * -------------
 * `inbox_ops` discovers app-owned actions from a module-root `inbox-actions.ts`
 * and each definition carries its own `requiredFeature`. The execution engine
 * does NOT read that field. It resolves the RBAC feature from a hand-written
 * map instead:
 *
 *   packages/core/src/modules/inbox_ops/lib/executionEngine.ts:454
 *     -> getRequiredFeatureForAction()            (same file, :571-579)
 *     -> REQUIRED_FEATURES_MAP[action.actionType]
 *   packages/core/src/modules/inbox_ops/lib/constants.ts:12-22
 *     -> Record<InboxActionType, string>, closed union, nine built-in keys
 *
 * An app-owned action type is absent from that map, so `executionEngine.ts:456`
 * throws 403 "No required feature is mapped for action type ..." before the
 * generated registry is ever loaded and before the RBAC check runs. Super-admin
 * does not bypass it, because the throw happens first.
 *
 * Upstream already knows: `constants.ts:4-10` documents the duplication and
 * carries a TODO to consolidate with the generated registry.
 *
 * This file adds our key to that map so the engine can reach our `execute`.
 * It adds NOTHING else. The RBAC check at `executionEngine.ts:474-482` still
 * runs against the feature we register, and still denies a user who lacks it.
 *
 * Removal condition
 * -----------------
 * Delete this file and the single `applyCoreRequiredFeatureShim()` call in
 * `../di.ts` as soon as core either reads `definition.requiredFeature` from the
 * generated inbox-action registry, or exposes a registration API for the map.
 * The assertions below are designed to make that moment loud: a core version
 * that freezes or pre-fills the map fails boot with a readable error rather
 * than degrading into an unexplainable 403.
