/**
 * Makes the installed `inbox_ops` execution engine loadable from a CLI process.
 *
 * Why it is needed
 * ----------------
 * `executionEngine.executeByType()` reaches the action registry with a
 * webpack/esbuild alias specifier:
 *
 *   packages/core/src/modules/inbox_ops/lib/executionEngine.js:252
 *     await import('@/.mercato/generated/inbox-actions.generated')
 *
 * Next.js and the CLI bundler both rewrite `@/`. Plain Node does not, and the
 * engine runs from `dist/` (already compiled, so no bundler touches it). Calling
 * `executeAction()` from a CLI therefore fails with:
 *
 *   Cannot find package '@/.mercato' imported from .../dist/.../executionEngine.js
 *
 * What this does
 * --------------
 * Compiles the generated registry with `compileAppSourceFile` — documented by
 * `@open-mercato/shared/lib/bootstrap/dynamicLoader` as "the only supported way
 * to load app source from a plain Node process" — and teaches the running Node
 * resolver that this one specifier means that one artifact. Nothing else is
 * intercepted, no core file is patched, and the engine still performs its own
 * RBAC check, status claiming, events and proposal recalculation.
 *
 * This is CLI-only. The dev server and the production server never call it,
 * because a bundler already resolves the alias there.
 *
 * Removal condition
 * -----------------
 * Delete this file and its single call in `../cli.ts` once core resolves the
 * registry through a specifier plain Node can follow (a `#generated/...`
 * subpath import, or a registry injected through DI).
